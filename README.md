# FileExplorer
(This is the college project I'm working on in my Masters' degree.)

A platform independent, multi-threaded, multi-tabbed file explorer and manager application which is capable to browse and operate on both local as well as remote file systems. The remote file system is accessible via FTP protocol and the application is able to login on both anonymous and authorized user accounts. The application is able to perform all vital file and directory related operations and can also interoperate between the local and remote file systems while maintaining a similar user interface.
